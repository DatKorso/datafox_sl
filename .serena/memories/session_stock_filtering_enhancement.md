# Stock Filtering Enhancement - Session Summary

## Task Completed
Successfully enhanced the "🚨 Анализ ошибок карточек" (Error Cards Analysis) report by adding stock-based filtering functionality.

## Implementation Details

### What Was Added
1. **Stock Filtering Checkbox**: "Показать только товары с остатками" 
   - Located in filtering section alongside existing filters
   - Allows users to show only products with stock > 0

2. **Database JOIN Enhancement**:
   - Modified `load_error_data()` function to LEFT JOIN with `oz_products` table
   - Added `COALESCE(op.oz_fbo_stock, 0) as oz_fbo_stock` to get stock data
   - Ensures compatibility with existing data structure

3. **Results Table Enhancement**:
   - Added "Остаток" (Stock) column to the results table
   - Positioned between size and price columns for logical grouping
   - Proper numeric formatting with `st.column_config.NumberColumn`

4. **Filtering Logic**:
   - Implemented `filtered_df[filtered_df['oz_fbo_stock'] > 0]` when checkbox is enabled
   - Works seamlessly with existing filters (error types, brands, price ranges)
   - Updated warning query to also include stock data

5. **Detail View Update**:
   - Added stock information to detailed product cards
   - Maintains consistent data presentation across all views

### Technical Implementation
- **File**: `pages/12_🚨_Проблемы_Карточек_OZ.py`
- **Database Schema**: Uses existing `oz_products.oz_fbo_stock` field
- **Join Key**: `oz_vendor_code` field present in both tables
- **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

### Key Code Changes
1. Added stock filtering UI element in line ~160
2. Enhanced database query with LEFT JOIN in `load_error_data()`
3. Added stock column to table display configuration
4. Implemented filtering logic in main filtering section
